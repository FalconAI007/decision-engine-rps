# Decision Engine: Phase Shift

This project is a Rock-Paper-Scissors web app developed as part of the ACM Tech Team recruitment task. While the core game logic is simple, I wanted to take a more creative approach by adding a sci-fi storyline, smooth transitions, and a themed user experience.

## Concept

The game is based around a fictional system called the **Decision Engine**, created by ACM (Archive of Conscious Minds). The player is treated as an anomaly being evaluated by an ancient machine intelligence. Inspired by concepts from *The Matrix* and storytelling styles used in Christopher Nolan’s films, the game adds meaning and style to each decision made by the user.

## Features

- Story-driven game flow with typewriter intro
- Game modes: Best of 5 and Best of 10
- Background video and themed music
- Sci-fi narrative messages for each move
- Final result message based on player outcome
- Restart option with contextual story
- Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Media assets (video, audio, images)
- Hosted using Vercel

## How it Works

1. The game begins with a short sci-fi intro displayed in a typewriter animation.
2. After selecting a game mode, the player can choose rock, paper, or scissors.
3. The system responds with dynamic messages based on both the player’s and computer’s moves.
4. After all rounds are complete, a final message is shown based on the result.
5. A restart option lets the user replay the game with a fresh round selection.

## Hosting

The project is hosted on Vercel, and all updates to the GitHub repository automatically reflect on the live site.

## Notes

This project helped me understand how even simple web applications can be enhanced through storytelling and UI design. While the core logic is basic, adding narrative elements, transitions, and custom feedback made the experience more engaging.

I also learned how to structure a project, manage assets, and make it responsive for both desktop and mobile. Hosting it on Vercel was straightforward, and now I have a clearer idea of how front-end projects go from local development to being live on the web.

Overall, I tried to make something that reflects both creativity and technical learning, and I hope it offers a different take on a familiar game.
